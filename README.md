## Introduction

GinvereeBot is a bot where that handle room booking. It has 2 types of user which are admin and user, which is the
customer. In this part, we will be focusing more on user. For user, there are a total of 3 functions in it.

Firstly, book a room. This is where user will have to select which room user wants to book and enter personal details in
it for booking purposes. If user entered wrong personal details, user can change it instantly before confirming the
booking. After the booking has been confirmed, a booking ID will be given to user for tracking purposes. Booking ID is
extremely important for further use

Second function is update personal details. GinvereeBot has considered that user might overlook and realized the
personal details are incorrect. Therefore, this function is provided for user to update the personal details after-hand.
User will have to provide (key in) the booking ID in order to update.

Next function is cancel booking. Booking that has been made can be cancelled after considerations. User will have to
enter booking Id and the cancellation processes will be done.
